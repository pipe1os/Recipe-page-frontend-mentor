## My process

I started by structuring the content semantically using HTML, based on the provided design. Then, I gradually applied CSS styles, first setting up custom fonts, color variables, and base styles. After that, I focused on the overall layout using Flexbox and designed the main recipe card. Step by step, I styled each section (preparation time, ingredients, instructions, and nutrition) by following the style guide and using the design image as my main reference. Finally, I added personal touches like gradients and shadows to enhance the visual appearance.

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup:** Used for structuring the content with appropriate tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`-`<h3>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<table>`, etc., ensuring accessibility and SEO benefits.
- **CSS3:** Applied for styling and visual presentation, including:
  - **CSS Custom Properties:** For efficient management and consistency of colors and other design tokens.
  - **Flexbox:** Utilized for layout control and alignment of key elements.
  - **Custom Fonts (`@font-face`):** Integration of 'Young Serif' and 'Outfit' for specific typography.
  - **Gradients:** Applied `linear-gradient` for the `body` background.
  - **Responsive Design:** Implemented using Media Queries (`@media`) to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, primarily mobile-first.
- **Git:** Used for version control throughout the development process.

### What I learned

During this project, I strengthened my skills in semantic HTML markup and CSS styling. I practiced using CSS Custom Properties to manage colors and fonts more efficiently. I also used Flexbox to center content and structure the card layout. It was a great exercise in closely following a style guide and a specific design, with careful attention to details like spacing, typography, and colors.
